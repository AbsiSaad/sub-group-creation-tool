"""
This module contains the server side logic for the Sub Group Creation Tool.

The purpose of this DocType is to make it easy for education managers to
create "sub groups" beneath an existing Student Group. A sub group is a
collection of students filtered from a main group based on criteria such as
program, course, batch and instructor. The tool exposes a few helper
functions that fetch the relevant students from the main group and populate
the child table on the form.

The fields on the DocType correspond to the UI described in the design
sketch provided by the user. See sub_group_creation_tool.json for details.

Note: This DocType does not automatically persist newly created Student
Group documents; rather it prepares the data for creation. Actual sub
group creation can be performed in a custom script or extended as needed.
